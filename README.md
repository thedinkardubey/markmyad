Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security method where user permissions are grouped into roles. Instead of assigning rights individually, you define roles like "Admin" (full access) or "Viewer" (read-only), then assign users to roles. This simplifies management, reduces errors, and enforces least privilege—giving just enough access for tasks. Scalable for teams!
